# Arduino Agent MCP bridge

A tiny stdio ⇄ HTTP bridge for the MCP server embedded in Arduino Agent.

## Why

The MCP server runs *inside* the IDE, so it only listens on `127.0.0.1:3847`
while the IDE is open. If your MCP client connects to that URL directly, the
whole server shows up as **failed to connect** whenever the IDE happens to be
closed — which looks like a broken integration rather than an idle one.

This bridge is a stdio MCP server that your client spawns as a child process, so
**connecting always succeeds**, and the Arduino tools stay usable while the IDE
is closed:

- The client always sees the real tool list, not an empty one.
- Browsing the tools (`list_tool_categories`, `get_category_tools`,
  `search_tools`) and the prompts work without the IDE.
- A tool that needs the IDE **starts it and waits for it** when
  `ARDUINO_AGENT_PATH` is set — the first call is just slower. Without it, the
  call returns a plain "open the IDE" message.
- When the IDE comes up (or restarts) the bridge notices on its own and tells
  the client if the tool list changed. **No client restart required.**

## Usage

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "arduino": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-bridge/bridge/arduino-agent-bridge.js"],
      "env": { "ARDUINO_AGENT_PATH": "/path/to/Arduino Agent executable" }
    }
  }
}
```

Where to find it:

| Running from | Bridge path |
|--------------|-------------|
| Release, Windows / Linux | `<unzipped folder>/resources/mcp-bridge/bridge/arduino-agent-bridge.js` |
| Release, macOS | `Arduino Agent.app/Contents/Resources/mcp-bridge/bridge/arduino-agent-bridge.js` (`Arduino IDE.app` in 0.6.2) |
| Source checkout | `arduino-mcp-extension/bridge/arduino-agent-bridge.js`, after `yarn build` in `arduino-mcp-extension` |

Releases after v0.6.1 include the bridge; earlier zips don't, so use a checkout
with those. Either way the bridge sits next to the compiled extension modules it
loads (`../lib/common/`), which supply the offline tool list and answers.

No dependencies (node builtins only) and no token setup — it reads
`~/.arduinoIDE/mcp-token` itself, re-reading per request so it survives the IDE
regenerating the token on restart.

## Options

All optional, set as environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `ARDUINO_MCP_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:3847/mcp` | MCP endpoint to forward to |
| `ARDUINO_MCP_TOKEN` | *(reads the token file)* | Override the auth token |
| `ARDUINO_AGENT_PATH` | *(unset — never launches)* | Path to the IDE executable. When set, a tool call that needs the IDE while it is closed starts it, waits for its MCP server and then runs the call. Concurrent calls share one launch; if the IDE never answers, the bridge doesn't start it again until it has been seen running. A path written for a pre-0.7.0 release (`Arduino IDE.exe`, `Arduino IDE.app/...`) that no longer exists falls back to the renamed `Arduino Agent` executable. |
| `ARDUINO_MCP_LAUNCH_TIMEOUT` | `120` | Seconds to wait for a started IDE's MCP server |
| `ARDUINO_MCP_WATCH_INTERVAL` | `5` | Seconds between checks for the IDE coming up (a local TCP connect) |
| `ARDUINO_MCP_DEBUG` | *(off)* | Set to `1` for verbose logging on stderr |

Example on Windows:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "arduino": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:/Arduino Agent/resources/mcp-bridge/bridge/arduino-agent-bridge.js"],
      "env": { "ARDUINO_AGENT_PATH": "C:/Arduino Agent/Arduino Agent.exe" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Behaviour when the IDE is closed

| Request | Response |
|---------|----------|
| `initialize` | Succeeds (answered locally) with the server's workflow `instructions` and the `prompts` capability, so the client connects fully featured |
| `tools/list` | The IDE's own list if this bridge has seen it, otherwise the compiled definitions for the tool mode in `~/.arduinoIDE/settings.json` (`arduino.mcp.toolMode`, router by default) |
| `tools/call` — `list_tool_categories`, `get_category_tools`, `search_tools` | Answered locally, identical to the server (both use `runRouterDiscoveryTool`) |
| `tools/call` — anything else | With `ARDUINO_AGENT_PATH`: starts the IDE, waits (sending progress notifications if the client asked for them), then runs the call. Otherwise, or if the IDE doesn't come up: a tool result with `isError: true` saying what to do |
| `prompts/list`, `prompts/get` | Answered locally from the compiled prompts |
| `resources/list`, `resources/templates/list` | Empty lists |

When the IDE comes up, the bridge fetches its tool list and sends
`notifications/tools/list_changed` if it differs from what the client was given
(for example, the IDE runs in `direct` mode).

The instructions are loaded from the compiled extension when present (source
of truth) with an embedded fallback; the smoke test asserts bridge/server
parity so the copies cannot drift silently.

Session handling is automatic: if the IDE restarts and invalidates the session
(HTTP 404) or rotates the token (HTTP 401), the bridge re-runs the handshake and
retries the request once. A token that is still rejected comes back as a
readable tool error rather than a protocol failure.

Tests: `yarn test:bridge` in `arduino-mcp-extension` (after `yarn build`) runs
the bridge against a fake IDE server.

> stdout carries only the JSON-RPC stream; all diagnostics go to stderr.
